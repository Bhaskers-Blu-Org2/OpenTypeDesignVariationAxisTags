# Proposals

Every proposal should be submitted under the Proposals folder, within a separate sub-folder
for the proposal. Updates to proposals should be within the same sub-folder, not a new folder.

If a proposed axis becomes registered, the sub-folder name for that proposal will be renamed
to reflect the state. For example, &ldquo;Spacing-REGISTERED-2017-12-31&rdquo;. If a proposal
is abandoned, the sub-folder name will be renamed to append &ldquo;-CUT&rdquo;.

A proposal can include multiple files for information or demonstration, but a copy of the
[ProposalSummary.md](ProposalSummary.md) file (found within this folder) must always be
included.
